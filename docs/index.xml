      <description>Changes in the ocean heat are strongly linked to the heat flux at the ocean-atmosphere boundary and therefore play a major role in modulating the Earth’s climate. However, significant uncertainties still exist in in-situ derived estimates and certain regions of the ocean are still poorly sampled. ROCSTAR, will provide new insights in the Earth’s energy budget by improving oceanic temperature (T) and salinity (S) estimates. This is accomplished by combining space geodetic data together with Argo profiles, solving for temperature, salinity and regionally varying sea level contributions simultaneously.</description>
