The EGU 2020 experience turns out to be different as expected and everything is now happening online, due to the Covid situation. This means that Alisa Yakhontova is now sharing her first results through the live chat in [session OS4.1](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/session/37135). You can find her presentation [here](https://presentations.copernicus.org/EGU2020/EGU2020-3546_presentation.pdf)

**Topic: Consistency of observed sea surface height changes, bottom pressure changes and temperature, salinity variations in a South Atlantic transect of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current**. 

The philosophy behind using the South Atlantic is that we're interested in studying the Antarctica Circumpolar Current (so to speak one of the Earth's main bloodvessels). And, since we have in situ bottom pressure measurements along a transsect, it can serve as a test bed for our methdology.
