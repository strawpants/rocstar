**ROCSTAR** (**R**esolving **O**cean heat **C**ontent changes by combining **S**pace gravime**T**ry, **A**rgo and **R**adar altimetry) will provide new insights in the Earthâ€™s energy budget by improving oceanic temperature (T) and salinity (S) estimates. This is accomplished by combining space geodetic data together with Argo profiles, solving for temperature, salinity and regionally varying sea level contributions simultaneously.
